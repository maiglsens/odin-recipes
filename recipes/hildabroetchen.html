    <h3>This is my grandma's amazing Hildabrötchen recipe</h3>
        <p>Like with my mum's Linzertorte, there is nothing much to say here, except: Try and be amazed ;-)</p>


    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        
    <h5>For the dough</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>300g wheat flour</li>
            <li>150g butter or margarine</li>
            <li>120g sugar</li>
            <li>1 pck vanillin sugar</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
        </ul>

    <h5>For the filling and icing</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>raspberry jam</li>
            <li>125g powdered sugar</li>
            <li>2 tbsp hot water</li>
            <li>a few drops of a lemon</li>
        </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <p><li>Sieve the <em>flour </em> into a bowl then cut the <em>butter</em> into tiny pieces before adding them into the bowl together with the <em>sugar, vanillin sugar</em> and <em>egg</em>.</li></p>
            <p><li>Mix it all together and knead until you got a smooth and even consistency.</li></p>
            <p><li>Put the dough into the refridgerator for an hour.</li></p>
            <p><li>After cooling take the dough and roll it out on a flat surface. Make sure it has an even thikness of about 3mm. </li></p>
            <p><li>Now take a round or flower shaped cookie cutter (~5cm diameter) and cut out the whole dough. Make sure you have an even number at the end, as they will go in pairs.</li></p>
            <p><li>Using one half of the cookies you now want to cut out smaller holes of the same shape (round or flower shaped) from their middle.</li></p>
            <p><li>Put all the cookies (with and without hole) onto a baking tray and bake them for 10-12 minutes at 170°C.</li></p>
            <p><li>When done baking let them cool off for a bit before spreading the <em>raspberry jam</em> on all the cookies without a hole in the middle.</li></p>
            <p><li>Now press the remaining cookies (the ones with the holes in the middle) lightly onto the jam. We're nearly done now.</li></p>
            <p><li>The only thing missing now is the icing. Take the <em>powdered sugar</em> and mix it with the <em>hot water</em> and the <em>lemon</em>. You now should have a gooey sugar icing.</li></p>
            <p><li>Finally apply the icing onto the Hildabrötchen (the part with the hole in it) and you're done.</li></p>
            <p><li>I always let the Hildabrötchen sit for a while so the dough can soak in a bit of the jam what makes them even more delicious.</li></p>
            <p><li>Enjoy! :-)</li></p>
        </ol>
